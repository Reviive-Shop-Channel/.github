  The Reviive Shop Channel is a community-driven project, which means it relies on the support and contributions of dedicated fans and developers. Our goal is to bring back the experience of the Wii Shop Channel for the Wii. Remember when you could download channels, WiiWare, and Virtual Console titles? Or maybe you never experienced that? With Reviive Shop Channel, you can experience it again! The Reviive Shop Channel runs on any Wii console, is region-free, and also works on Wii U via Wii Mode. It provides WiiWare, Virtual Consoles, and Wii Channels.

----------------------------------------
 
<b>Reviive Shop Channel History!</b>
 <br>
----------------------------------------
<br>
  July 7th, 2024 <br>
  MattTheTekie has left due to fears of instability in project management and poor future-forward direction.
 January 20, 2024 <br>
Reviive Shop Channel started that day, and the team featured Wabagg123,  ̶D̶a̶k̶o̶t̶a̶t̶h̶  , Chile Coder and  ̶J̶u̶s̶t̶W̶M̶.
<br><br>
 January 28, 2024 <br>
Reviive Shop Channel got the WSC to load, thanks to Wabagg123's work. Our first showcase of the shop was working but was very buggy and had issues.
<br><br>
 February 16, 2024 <br>
MattTheTekie was introduced to the team, with Thom joining just a few days earlier. Matt helped to host the shop temporarily.
<br><br>
 February 18-20, 2024 <br>
MattTheTekie got the shop working for himself. It was very buggy, and we discovered that Chile Coder's points system didn't work, so we had to remove it soon after.
<br><br>
 February 28, 2024 <br>
Reviive Shop Channel's logo was updated to be more HD and have holiday logos.
<br><br>
 June 19, 2024 <br>
fin joined Reviive and helped people transfer their New Shop Channel data into Reviive Shop Channel and made a new account system for Reviive Shop Channel with usernames and passwords instead of Wii serials.
<br><br>
 June 23, 2024 <br>
The official Reviive website was released at https://ftolnks.xyz and is hosted by fin.
<br><br>
 June 30 - July 3 2024 <br>
Reviive Shop Channel was fully recoded and no longer uses RiiShop code, and now uses a custom secure account system by fin.

----------------------------------------

Thats all the history as of 7/3/24, <br> thank you for supporting us over these 6 long months (as of 7/3/24).
